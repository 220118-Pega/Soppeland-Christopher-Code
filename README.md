My name is Christopher Soppeland

I have an Associate's degree in Information Systems and worked as a Web Developer for 4 years but have not been in the field since 2013. 

Since then I have worked as a driver for Domino's, Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, and Amazon. Most recently I was working as a Handyman mounting, fixing, and assembling many things for people.

I am excited to get back into the field and very grateful for this opportunity.

Wish I had heard of Revature years ago but no crying over spilled milk. I am here now and confident that I will absolutely crush it.

My only real hobby is RC cars. I find running, crashing and fixing them theraputic.
